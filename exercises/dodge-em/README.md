Exercise : Dodge-em! 
For this exercise, I chose to keep a somewhat similar code to the original "covid activity" that we did but change things up and add extra pieces. 
In order to play, the user must hold the mouse button down to move around (you play as the yellow circle). The aim of the game is to avoid the purple circles coming at you from both the left hand side and the top of the screen. If you are on the left side of the screen, the entire window turns purple, and if you are on the right, it turns yellow. This makes the game more challenging as you are either losing yourself or losing your enemies in the process of trying to survive. Once the player dies, the screen turns red and they are met with a clown and "GAME OVER".
