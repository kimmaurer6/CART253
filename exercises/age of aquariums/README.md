I accidentally had stored the exercise in the wrong folder so my commits may not appear here, hopefully there is a way for you to find my commit history.
For this assignment, I created a "butterfly catching simulator!" 
The player controls a little guy holding a catching net and it is their goal to catch all of the butterflies before 21 seconds have passed!
Use the WASD keys to control your character and win the game!
