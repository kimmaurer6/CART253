For my project, I did a "Taylor Swift Simulator". 
In this game, you play as Taylor Swift as she attempts to either go home or find love but is being chased by a deranged fan and the paparazzi! You must avoid the fan and paparazzi by using the WASD keys to move around and get to your preferred ending!
I decided that every ending should have a Taylor Swift lyric associated with it, I thought it to be a cute addition to the game. 
Will you find your way home? Will you manage to find love? Or will you get caught by those who stalk and follow your every move.
