# Project 2 - Sonic Invaders

For this project, I wanted to put my own little spin on a Space Invaders x Sonic game. The premise is that you play as sonic but he disappears between the first and second level - the only way to get him back is to defeat the final two levels, including a "boss battle."
I didn't want to just copy Space Invaders bar-for-bar so I added in the concept of sonic going "missing" (becoming invisible in the game) and the ultimate goal of the game being to find him and bring him back. I thought this would add to the creativity aspect of the project with there being a story of sorts behind the game - lore, as one may call it. I thought it would be too boring to have just a simple shooter game with no substance or "challenge" to it. The user becoming invisible adds distinct challenge to the game (trust me, I have failed my own game multiple times because of it haha).
I think I did a relatively good job of having a comfortable user experience. The controls are the standard video game controls, with WASD as movement keys and the spacebar to shoot - like most keyboard controlled fps games.
